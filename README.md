</p>

# Development
CoffeeApp was developed using SDK Flutter, it is possible to analyze images of leaves, fruits and flowers. The user is able to determine the number of images to be taken, order the graphics and get recommendations for:
- field management recommendation;
- product application recommendation;
- flowering forecast;
- harvest forecast;
- beverage quality forecast;
- sell your coffee
# Examples and features of interfaces
- The images of the leaves are randomly selected to simulate different photos of leaves, at the end simulates the request to calculate the result
- I changed the design of the treatments screen and block if the user does not choose any of the options 
- After the user follows the entire flow, the data such as: current temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, local, were integrated with an API and below shows an image simulating the temperature of the next times.
